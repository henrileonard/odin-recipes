<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>900 g chicken wings</li>
    <li>½ Tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ Tsp ground black pepper</li>
    <li>60 g potato starch</li>
    <li>30 g all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> ½ Tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the sauce</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 Tsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>80 ml ketchup</li>
    <li>80 ml rice syrup</li>
    <li>60 g gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
    <li>2 Tsp white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 Tsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Corn (or vegetable) oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 5 cm of oil in a large heavy frying pan or pot over medium-high heat for about 10 to 12 minutes until the oil temperature reaches 165-175ºC. I used my 30 cm pan, but if your pan is smaller, work in batches. If you don’t have a thermometer, test it by dipping one piece of chicken in the oil. If it bubbles, it is ready.</li>
    <li>While the oil is heating, combine chicken, salt, ground black pepper, starch, flour, baking soda, and eggs in a large bowl. Mix altogether well by hand.</li>
    <li>Add the coated chicken to hot oil one by one. Fry them for 12 minutes until all sides of the chicken are golden brown and crunchy, turning over with tongs.</li>
    <li>Take out the chicken with tongs or a large slotted spoon to a wire strainer over a bowl to remove the excess oil.</li>
    <li>Heat 10 ml vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic until light brown for about 30 seconds. Add the ketchup, rice syrup, gochujang, vinegar, and stir well with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to low and stir until bubbling. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Let the oil heat up for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until it reaches 165-175ºC.</li>
    <li>Fry the chicken one more time, turning over with tongs for about another 12 minutes until very crunchy.</li>
    <li>Reheat the sauce over medium-high heat until it's bubbling again. Add all the hot crunchy chicken and mix well with a wooden spoon and tongs.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and transfer to a serving plate. Serve with chicken-mu (pickled radish) if you have it.</li>
