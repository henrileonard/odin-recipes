<p>Mapo tofu is a popular Sichuan dish featuring soft tofu set in a spicy, 
    savory sauce made from fermented bean paste, ground pork, and Sichuan peppercorns,
     which give it a distinctive numbing sensation. It's renowned for its bold flavors, 
     combining heat, umami, and a hint of tanginess, making it a favorite in Chinese cuisine.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>400g pressed tofu</li>
    <li>2 spring onions</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp oil</li>
    <li>100g ground beef or pork</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp chili bean paste</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp black bean garlic sauce</li>
    <li>1 Tsp chili oil</li>
    <li>100ml chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 Tsp sugar</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 Tsp corn starch</li>
    <li>1 Tsp Sichuan peppercorns</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the tofu into 2 cm cubes. Clean, wash, and diagonally slice the spring onions.</li>
    <li>Heat a pan or wok on high heat, add oil, and swirl to distribute it evenly. Sear the minced meat, breaking it up with a wooden spatula until it becomes crumbly. It should be slightly browned but not dry. Reduce the heat to medium, add the chili bean sauce, and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until the oil turns red. Add the black bean garlic sauce and chili oil.</li>
    <li>Pour in the chicken broth, mix well, and add the tofu cubes. Carefully combine to avoid breaking the tofu. Season with sugar and light soy sauce, taste, and let it simmer on low heat for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the spring onions. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water and carefully stir it into the pan until the sauce slightly thickens and the ingredients are coated with a glossy layer.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with Szechuan pepper and serve immediately.</li>
    <li>Serving tip: Serve with freshly steamed jasmine rice.</li>
</ol>
